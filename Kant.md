# Kant
Tried to work out how human beings could be good and kind outside of the exaltations and 
blandishments of traditional religions. 

Born in 1724, in the Baltic city of Konigsberg.

*Religion within the bounds of reason alone*

‘Categorical Imperative’: Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will 
that it should become a universal law. 

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 

Act so as to treat people always as ends in themselves, never as mere means. 

Intended as a replacement for the Christian injunction for universal love, the command to “love one’s neighbor”. 

A free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same 

A universally valid will under which everyone can be free 

So government ideally is the externalized, institutionalized version of the best parts of ourselves.

In 1793, Kant published a major work on beauty and art, “The Critique of Judgment.”

Kant held that his ideas about art and beauty were the cornerstones of his entire philosophy. 

Kant thought that life involved a constant struggle between our better selves and our passions, 
between duty and pleasure. 

Beauty, Kant especially liked roses, vines, apple trees and birds, delights us in a very special and 
important way. It’s a reminder of and goad to our better selves, unlike so much else in our lives, 
our love of beauty is in Kant’s word “disinterested,” it takes us out of our narrow, selfish 
concerns but in a charming delightful way without being stern or demanding.

The beauty of nature is a continual, quiet, and insistent reminder of our common universal being.

For Kant, the role of art is to embody the most important ethical ideas. It’s a natural extension of 
philosophy Kant held that we needed to have art continually before us, so as to benefit from vivid 
illustrations and memorable symbols of good behavior and thereby keep the wayward parts of ourselves 
in check. 

As Kant saw it, he was engaged in the task of developing a secular, rational version of what 
religions had, very imperfectly, always attempted to do, help us to be good.
