1.	Important part of ourselves can be found in history.

    -	Every era can be looked at as a repository of a particular kind of wisdom  

2.	Learn from ideas you dislike 

    -	Ask “What sliver of sense and reason might be contained in otherwise frightening or foreign phenomena?”

3.	Progress is Messy 

    - Hegel believed the world makes progress, but only by lurching from one extreme to another. As it seeks to overcompensate for a previous mistake. 

    - He proposes that it generally takes three moves before the right balance on any issue can be found. A process that he named the DIALEKTIK. 

    - All this can seem the most appalling waste of time, but Hegel insists that the painful stepping form era to era is inevitable. Something we must expect and reconcile ourselves to when planning our lives or contemplating history books. And sometimes in this process of moving from era to era we’ll find a new solution, that manages to synthesize the good qualities of the previous solutions, to make something really new, and different and better. 

4.	Art has a purpose

    - Art is in Hegel’s formulation: “the sensuous presentation of ideas.”

    - The point of art Hegel realized, is not so much to come up with startling new strange ideas but to take the good, helpful, important thoughts we already think we know, and make them stick more imaginatively in our minds. 

5.	We need new institutions

	  - For ideas to be active and effective in the world, a lot more is needed then the ideas are simply correct; to make major truths powerful in society they need employees and building and budgets and legal advices; institutions allow for the scale of time and power the big projects need to become effective in the world. 

His insight is the growth requires that clash of divergent ideas and therefore that will be painful and slow.
