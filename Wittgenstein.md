# Ludwig Wittgenstein 
Communication problems 

Born in Vienna in 1889, the youngest child of a wealthy, highly cultured, but domineering steel magnate.

1921 *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*

How do human beings manage to communicate ideas to one another?

Language works by triggering within us pictures of how things are in the world.

Words enable us to make pictures of facts

We’re constantly swapping pictures between us 

We’re very bad at managing to make good pictures in the minds of others.

Communication typically goes wrong because other people have, as we put it, the wrong picture of what we’re meaning.

Problems of communication typically start because we don’t have a clear and accurate enough picture of what we mean in our own heads.

There’s another danger: that we read more meaning into the words of others than they ever intended or than is warranted.

To speak more carefully and less impulsively.  
“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” 

Philosophical Investigations. 

Language is like a kind of tool that we use to play different games, which doesn’t literally mean games, more patterns of intentions. 

All kinds of misunderstandings arise when we don’t see which kind of game someone is involved in.

Wittgenstein also wanted to draw attention to how much of our self-understanding depends on the words of others, on languages that have developed publicly and communally over many centuries long before we’re born.

Words help us to name elusive areas of our own experience. 

Language is a public tool for the understanding of private life.

The richness of the language we’re exposed to is therefore really important to our self-knowledge. Reading many books gives us tools with which to help to know who we are.

Wittgenstein’s philosophy is underpinned by a desire always to be helpful. 

The task of philosophy, said Wittgenstein, is to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle. The particular fly bottle, he was interested in, was language.
