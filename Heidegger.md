# Heidegger
1.	We have forgotten to notice we’re alive. 
    - Mystery of existence – ‘das Sein’(Being) ‘das Nichts’(The Nothing)

2.	We have forgotten that all Being is connected – ‘the Unity of Being’
3.	We forget to be free and to live for ourselves. ‘Thrownness’ (Geworfenheit)
‘Uneigentlichkeit’ (Inauthenticity) to ‘Eigentlichkeit’ (Authenticity)
    - We merely surrender to a socialized, superficial mode of being he called ‘they-self’ 
    (as opposed to ‘our-selves’). 

    - We follow The Chatter (‘das Gerede’), which we hear about in newspapers, on TV and in the large cities 
    Heidegger hated to spend time in. 

    - What will help us to pull away from the ‘they-self’ is an appropriately intense focus on our own 
    upcoming death. 'Das Nichts’ (The Nothing)

    - Spend more time ‘in graveyards’
