Wake up and give up our cozy sentimental illusions 

He systematically attacks the pillars of modern life: our faith in family, our trust in work, our attachment to love, and our general sense that life has purpose and meaning.

His enemies were the smug in all their guises, particularly, the prosperous Danish haute bourgeoisie, and the members of the established Danish church. 

The only intelligent tactical response to life’s horror is to laugh defiantly at it. 

Kierkegaard is often described as the founder of the philosophical movement known as “existentialism”

In 1844 *“The Concept of Anxiety”*, he emphasized a new word “angest”/”angst”, a condition where we understand how many choices we face, and how little understanding we can ever have of how to exercise these choices wisely. 

As Kierkegaard wrote, “Life can only be understood backwards, but must be lived forwards”.

“It’s not possible for anyone to be absolutely, and in every conceivable way, completely content, not even for a single half hour of his life.”

“Leap of faith”

1849 *“The Sickness unto Death”* To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.
