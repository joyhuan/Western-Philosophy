# Sartre 
Born in Paris in 1905. 

By the 60’s Sartre was a household name in both Europe and the US, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. 

*Being and Nothingness*(1943)

1.	Things are weirder than we think “the Absurdity of the World”
2.	We are free 

    a)	The “angoisse” or “anguish” of existence. 
3.	We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad Faith’

    a)	We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. 
4.	We’re free to dismantle capitalism. 

The admission that life doesn’t have some preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo. 

## 1905-1980 Sartre on: Bad Faith 
In *Being and Nothingness* written in 1943, the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre identified a problem which he believed plagued modern life. 

Mauvaise Foi (literally ‘bad faith’)

Bad faith occurs when we lie to ourselves in order to spare ourselves short term pain, but thereby suffer from long term psychological impoverishment. 

We force ourselves to believe something which we’re not really convinced by, because it’s easier. 

In particular, Sartre believe that what we constantly lie to ourselves about is that we don’t have other options. 

Often happen around work. 

But it’s not true, insists Sartre, we’re all free. 

There are scary, almost sickening moments of what Sartre calls Negative Ecstasy, which might come late at night, when we realize that we are in fact far more free than we ever say we are. 

The price is that we close off the opportunities for changing and improving our lives.

We forget, Sartre says, that “Being precedes essence”

“All the things we are at present not, but could possibly become”

So bad faith closes down on the options of freedom. 

Sartre detected bad faith as a feature of many unhappy relationships. 

Sartre didn’t see bad faith as a surprising or unusual problem. It’s a natural outcome of how our minds work. He didn’t want us to feel bad. He just wanted to remind us to be as free as we really are.
