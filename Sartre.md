# Sartre 
Born in Paris in 1905. 

By the 60’s Sartre was a household name in both Europe and the US, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. 

*Being and Nothingness*(1943)

1.	Things are weirder than we think “the Absurdity of the World”
2.	We are free 

    a)	The “angoisse” or “anguish” of existence. 
3.	We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad Faith’

    a)	We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. 
4.	We’re free to dismantle capitalism. 

The admission that life doesn’t have some preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.
