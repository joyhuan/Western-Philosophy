# Blaise Pascal 
Born in Auvergne in central France in June 1623 

*Pensees*

The purpose of the book was to convert readers to God and Pascal felt the best way to do this was to evoke everything that was terrible about life.

The first part of the book, listing what’s wrong with life has always proved far more popular than the second, which suggest what’s so right with God.

“All of man’s unhappiness comes from his inability to stay peaceful alone in his room.”

Pascal’s charm lies in his bitterness and tart cynicism. 

“What is man? A nothing compared to the infinite.”

“Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself.”

Misery is the norm – “If our condition were truly happy we should not need to divert ourselves from thinking about it.”

True love is a chimera – “How hollow and foul is the heart of man.”

We are as think-skinned as we are vain – “A trifle consoles us because a trifle upsets us.”

Even the strongest among us are rendered helpless by the countless diseases to which we’re vulnerable. “Flies are so mighty that they can paralyze our minds and eat up our bodies.” 

All worldly institutions are corrupt – “Nothing is surer than that people will be weak.”

We are absurdly prone to overestimate our own importance. “How many kingdoms know nothing of us!”

“Man’s greatness comes from knowing he is wretched.”

If Pascal’s pessimism can so effectively console us, it’s because we usually cast into gloom not so much by negativity as by hope.
