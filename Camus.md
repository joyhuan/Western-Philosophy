The novel captures the state of mind, defined by the sociologist Emile Durkheim, as “Anomie,” a listless, affectless, alienated condition where one feels entirely cut off from others and can’t find a way to share their sympathies or values.

“Meursault doesn’t play the game. He refuses to lie … he says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings … and so society immediately feels threatened.”

The opening “Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don’t know.”
The ending is stark and is defiant “My last wish was that there should be a crowd of spectators at my execution … and that they should greet me with cries of hatred.”

“The Myth of Sisyphus” too has a bold beginning – “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem … and that is suicide … Judging whether life is or is not worth living, that is the fundamental question of philosophy.”

Existentialists – Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre

But ultimately, Camus suggests we should cope as well as we can at whatever we have to do, we have to acknowledge the absurd background to existence, and then triumph of the constant possibility of hopelessness. 

In his famous formulation “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

Live intensely 

He said he saw his philosophy as “A lucid invitation to live and to create in the very midst of the desert.”

Speaking of football – “After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport.”

Praise sun - “For the first time in two thousand years the body has appeared naked on beaches, for twenty centuries men have striven to give decency to Greek insolence a naivety to diminish the flesh and complicate dress but today young men running on Mediterranean beaches repeat the gestures of the athletes of Delos.”

“I recall a magnificent, tall girl who danced all afternoon. She was wearing a jasmine garland on her tight blue dress wet with perspiration from the small of her back to her legs. She was laughing as she danced and throwing back her head as she passed the tables she left behind her a mingle scent of flowers and flesh.”

“If there is a sin against this life, it consists perhaps not so much into sparing of life as in hoping for another life and eluding the quiet grandeur of this one.”

“People attract me insofar as they are impassioned about life and avid for happiness… There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for.”

Camus’ favorite philosopher was Montaigne, another very down to earth Frenchmen, and someone one can love as much for what he wrote, as for what he was like. Someone one would have wanted as a wise and a life-enhancing friend. This, too, is what philosophy is about.
