# Western-Philosophy

I spent my summer 2015 at Amherst College reading great books in philosophies ranging from Plato to 
Nietzsche. Though I was perplexed and struggled at the time, I felt some connection with Nietzscheâ€™s 
ideas (only him from a pretty wide range of philosophers) somehow. Since 2015, I have devoted time 
to learn more about Nietzsche intermediately. I still vividly remember how I fought lethargy (in vain)
when I forced myself to keep reading after losing on the obscure sentences. Now I think about it, it 
was like meeting the right person at the wrong time. 

After four years of college, I understood better of my drives and values. I gradually started to 
realize vaguely what makes Nietzsche particularly resonated with me. At the same time, I began to be 
interested in how other philosophers think. So I started this repo to take notes.
