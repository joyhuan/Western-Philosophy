# Nietzsche
1.	Own up to envy: we must face up to our true desires, put up a heroic fight to honor them, and only then mourn failure with solemn dignity. Übermensch
2.	Don’t be a Christian Sklavenmoral
3.	Never Drink Alcohol. 
“There have been two great narcotics in European civilization: Christianity and alcohol”
Both numb pain, and both reassure us that things are just fine as they are, sapping us of the will to change our lives for the better. 
Nietzsche was obsessed with the awkward truth that getting really valuable things done hurts. 
4.	“God is Dead”
For Nietzsche, the 19th century was reeling under the impact of two developments: Mass Democracy and Atheism. The first threatened to unleash torrents of undigested envy; the second to leave humans without guidance or morality.
