# Nietzsche
1.	Own up to envy: we must face up to our true desires, put up a heroic fight to honor them, and only then mourn failure with solemn dignity. Übermensch
2.	Don’t be a Christian Sklavenmoral
3.	Never Drink Alcohol. 
“There have been two great narcotics in European civilization: Christianity and alcohol”
Both numb pain, and both reassure us that things are just fine as they are, sapping us of the will to change our lives for the better. 
Nietzsche was obsessed with the awkward truth that getting really valuable things done hurts. 
4.	“God is Dead”
For Nietzsche, the 19th century was reeling under the impact of two developments: Mass Democracy and Atheism. The first threatened to unleash torrents of undigested envy; the second to leave humans without guidance or morality. 

## Nietzsche on: Amor Fati (a love of one’s fate)
Or as we put it, a resolute, enthusiastic acceptance of everything that has happened in one;s life

*The Gay Science*, written during a period of great personal hardship for the philosopher, Nietzsche writes: I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things: then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer. 

And, a few years later, in *Ecce Homo* Nietzsche writes: My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely beat what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it. 

There is much emphasis in his work on action, initiative and self-assertion. His concept of the Wille zur Macht, or Will to Power embodies just this attitude of vitality and conquest over obstacles.

He wishes our mental toolkit to have more than one set of ideas: to have, as it were, both a hammer and a saw.
